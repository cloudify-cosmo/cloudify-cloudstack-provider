Cloudify CloudStack Provider
============================

DEPRACATED IN CLOUDIFY 3.1!

Beginning with Cloudify 3.1, bootstrapping a Cloudify Management Environment is done via a `manager blueprint`.
please refer to [Manager Blueprints](http://getcloudify.org/guide/3.1/installation-bootstrapping.html#manager-blueprints) for more info.


Cloudify's CloudStack provider provides the ability to bootstrap Cloudify's manager in a  [CloudStack](http://cloudstack.apache.org/) environment.

##Disclaimer

The code in this repository has been contributed by the Cloudify community (thanks [Roeland Kuipers](https://github.com/boul)). We intend to put it through our comprehensive testing framework in the near future, but until then please note that it's considered experimental and provided as is.
